# Data Structures Tutorial

## I. Welcome

Data structures are ways of organizing code in ways that increase efficiency. They are often used when organizing or looking through large amounts of data.

The way in which the efficiency is measured is using the Big O notation. What this does is looks at the worse case scenario of how long it could take to look through the data, and reduces it to the following measurements:

* O(1) - This is the most efficient method. It will take the same amount of time each time. It is constant, represented with the black line.
* O(n) - This depends on the variable with how long it would take. It is linear, represented with the blue line. 
* O(nÂ²) - This will take the variable and multiply it with itself, taking much longer with larger variables. It is exponential, represented with the red line.

This tutorial will cover three common data structures used in programming, and their respective Big O notations.
